# ReactJS Facebook messenger

The goal of this exercise is to learn how to use Redux in a React app.

## To get started

### Step 1

If you haven't already set up your project, head here and follow the instructions https://github.com/leanjscom/fb-messenger/blob/master/README.md


### Step 2
```sh
 git checkout redux
 ```

### Step 3
```sh
 npm i
 ```

## Exercise

1. Create a logger middleware to log in the console every action that is dispatched
2.1. `git checkout advanced-redux-part2`
2.2. When you run `yarn start` you'll get the following error: "Actions must be plain objects. Use custom middleware for async actions." To fix it you must create a thunk middleware in store/index.js.
2.3. When your thunk middleware works you should see the list of Threads on http://localhost:300X/messages
3.1. `git checkout advanced-redux-part3`
3.2 Refactor your logger and thunk middleware so you can use them along with `{ applyMiddleware } from 'redux'` in the createStore function
4. In configureStore.dev.js, replace the addLoggerMiddleware and addPromiseSupportToDispatch that you've created with the ones in npm: `redux-logger` and `redux-thunk`. Note, we already did `yarn add redux-logger` and `yarn add redux-thunk`.
5. Using thunks, add loading indicators to the fetchConversation action creator in /actions/conversation.js
6. use reselect to implement a conversation selector
