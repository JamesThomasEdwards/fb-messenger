## Exercise part 1

### ü•ë Before we start

- TODO EXPLAIN KEY KNOWLEDGE HERE FOR THIS EXERCISE

- [ ] 1. The profile page (http://localhost:3000/profile) should display the fullname of the user on the form input labeled "fullname" (right below the image). The fullname is not displayed on the input because of a bug üêõ. Your task is to fix it.
- [ ] 2. The profile page should display the name of the company on the form input labeled "Company" (right below the fullname). This feature is not implemented. You'll need to:
  - [ ] 2.1. Write the query to get the company that the user works for. I recommend you to write and test it first on Playground (http://localhost:3000/graphql)
  - [ ] 2.2. Tranform the query into an AST using the `gql` function
  - [ ] 2.3. Use the useQuery hook from Apollo.
